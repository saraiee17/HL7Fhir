# HL7® FHIR® Fundamentals  
**Learning Healthcare Interoperability with FHIR**

##  Overview  
This repository documents my journey as I learn **HL7 FHIR** (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), the modern standard for healthcare data exchange. My goal is to understand the fundamentals of FHIR, its architecture, and real-world applications in health tech systems.

## 🧠 Goals  
- Understand FHIR architecture & key concepts  
- Learn how healthcare systems exchange data using FHIR  
- Practice reading and constructing FHIR resources (e.g., `Patient`, `Observation`)  
- Explore RESTful interactions with real FHIR servers  
- Build a foundation for working in health tech and AI

##  🛠️ Tools  
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) – for testing FHIR APIs  
- [HAPI FHIR Server](https://hapi.fhir.org/) – public sandbox  
- [HL7 FHIR Spec](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) – official documentation
